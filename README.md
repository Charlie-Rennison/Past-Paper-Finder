# Past Paper Finder

AQA Combined Science Past Paper Finder

This project has been made as a part of my javascript learning journey.

## How it works

It works using https://www.aqa.org.uk/ URL pattern when they save past papers.

## Known issues

As it relies on AQA's past papers some will be missing due to covid etc. Any papers in 2020 June and 2021 November are missing due to covid. The current and previous year you are veiewing this are unavaliable due to AQA restricting the previous past paper access. I may some time look into how to solve these issues in the form of a error code when the paper doesn't exist.
