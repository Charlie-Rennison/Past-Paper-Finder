# Past Paper Finder

AQA Combined Science Past Paper Finder

This project has been made so that I can improve my JavaScript knowledge. If there are any things i can do better to improve this please let me know!

## How it works

It works using https://www.aqa.org.uk/ and https://www.mathsgenie.co.uk/ URL patterns.

## Known issues

As it relies on AQA's past papers some will be missing due to covid etc. Any papers in 2020 June and 2021 November are missing due to covid. The current and previous years you are viewing this are unavailable due to AQA restricting the previous past paper access. I may some time look into how to solve these issues in the form of an error code when the paper doesn't exist.
